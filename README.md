# Move Ball Exercise
This code allows a ball to move up and down the computer screen and when it gets to a predefine edge the ball changes color and then reverses  direction.  Once the ball goes back to the starting point the ball changes back to the orginal color and reverses direction again.  

## Future Improvements 
I would like to add a ball once the ball hits the edge.

## Run Code
You can run this exercise by copying the code in VS code and opening the HTML file in a web broswer.
